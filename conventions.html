 <h2>Coding Standards, Practices, and Conventions</h2>
 <div class="body">
  This document outlines the conventional practices used in the design and
  implementation of the Android library.
 </div>
 <h3>Hungarian Notation</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian notation</a> refers to an identifier-naming convention proposed by
   <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi">Charles Simonyi</a>
   at XEROX PARC. It proposes that each identifier's name begin with a
   semantically-meaningful prefix indicating the <b>pragmatic purpose</b> of the
   variable in a given context. This is referred to as "app Hungarian", as
   opposed to "systems Hungarian" which tries to strictly encode a variable's
   <b>programmatic type</b> into the prefix &mdash; a practice which would not
   be as useful in Java, which already enforces types for its variables.
  </p> <p>
   For notes describing the specific notations used in the zerobandwidth Android
   library, see <a href="hungarian.html">Notational Conventions</a>.
  </p>
 </div>
 <h3>The One True Brace Style (and other whitespace conventions)</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   The One True Brace Style is "always on the next line". Anything else that you
   have seen or heard to the contrary was trying nefariously to mislead you into
   a life of depravity and sin.
  </p> <p>
   Brackets around complicated expressions should have comfortable spacing
   within, while brackets around single identifiers may remain dense.
  </p> <p>
   Semicolons should be padded by a space from the end of the line, except where
   it would go over the canonical length of a line, which is 80 characters.
  </p>
 </div>
 <h3>JavaDoc Conventions</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   All classes, members, and methods shall be documented with JavaDoc comments.
   A new version of the library's complete JavaDoc set is generated with each
   release.
  </p> <p>
   Any class, member, or method which is added to the library shall be decorated
   with a <code>@since</code> annotation, showing that it is a part of the
   <code>zer0bandwidth-net/android</code> library, the version in which the item
   was added to the library, and the GitHub issue number to which the related
   commit was ascribed. This distinctive format, in addition to carrying
   valuable versioning information, is chosen to be obviously distinctive from
   the code provided by other <code>zer0bandwidth.net</code> libraries and apps,
   as well as the code produced by anyone who would consume this library.
  </p> <p>
   Similarly, any item which is deprecated from the library shall be decorated
   with a <code>@deprecated</code> annotation. This annotation will show the
   version of the library in which the item was first considered deprecated,
   and, if applicable, will also suggest a usable alternative/replacement, and
   describe the plans for removing the item from the library altogether.
  </p>
 </div>
 <h3>ADB Logging Patterns</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   Each class definition which writes anything to the ADB logs will include a
   static <code>LOG_TAG</code> constant which is used as the tag for Android
   system logs generated by that class. The value of this constant is,
   conventionally, the simple name of the class itself.
  </p> <p>
   When writing to the ADB logs, if there is any dynamic data to be included in
   the entry's text, then the text shall be composed with a 
   <code>StringBuilder</code>. We use this class for the following reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    It is faster and more efficient than concatenating each segment with the 
    <code>+</code> operator.
   </li> <li>
    It is faster and more efficient than the <code>String.format()</code>
    method.
   </li> <li>
    As each string is confined to a function call, it doesn't need the thread
    safety of <code>StringBuffer</code>.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The static portions of the log line should enclose the dynamic content with
   square-brackets, to make the value "pop" when reading the text of the entry
   in the ADB logs.
  </p>
 </div>
 <h3>Fluidity</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   Any non-static method that does not otherwise return a value should return
   the instance of the object that executed it, rather than being declared
   <code>void</code>. This allows consumers of the library class to invoke the
   class's methods in a long, continuous chain, rather than repeating its
   identifier multiple times.
  </p>
  <div class="code-block slightly-gray">
   <pre>
public class Water
{
    protected int m_nDrops = 0 ;
    protected Color m_color = Color.CLEAR ;

    public Water flowQuickly()
    { m_nDrops += 10 ; return this ; }

    public Water flowSlowly()
    { m_nDrops += 1 ; return this ; }

    public Water turnColor( Color color )
    { m_color = color ; return this ; }

    public String toString()
    {
        return (new StringBuilder())
            .append( "You have " ).append( m_nDrops )
            .append( " drops of " ).append( m_color.toString() )
            .append( " water." )
            .toString()
            ;
    }
}

public class WaterTest
{
    public void testWater()
    {
        String s = (new Water())
            .flowQuickly()
            .flowSlowly()
            .turnColor( Color.GREEN )
            .flowQuickly()
            .toString()
            ;
        assertEquals( "You have 21 drops of green water.", s ) ;
    }
}
   </pre>
  </div>
 </div>
 <h3>Reveal Nothing, Provide Everything</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   Each class should keep its member fields <code>protected</code> unless it is
   absolutely necessary to hide them at <code>private</code> scope for some
   specific reason. The <code>protected</code> scope conceals the inner workings
   of the class from its consumers, but allows classes in the same package to
   use the items directly. Most significantly, this allows classes that execute
   automated unit tests to access the class members directly when evaluating 
   test assertions, which makes the tests much more efficient, and easier to
   write. It also follows the general convention of "fluidity" described in the
   previous section.
  </p> <p>
   While member fields should be concealed behind <code>protected</code> scope,
   the class should also provide adequate accessor and mutator methods for those
   fields, where appropriate. Mutators for each field might or might not be
   required; instead, it might be more appropriate for a mutator to ingest a
   single object or set of inputs, from which the class members are extracted 
   and processed.
  </p> <p>
   Conventionally, the accessors and mutators provided by this library are not
   quite in the "bean" paradigm (whose mutators are declared <code>void</code>)
   but not quite the "builder" paradigm (in which mutators are fluid but in a
   separate class). Instead, the mutator methods themselves are fluid but still
   provided by the class itself; that is, <i>each class is its own 
   "builder"</i>. This allows consumers of the class to interact with it more
   easily.
  </p>
  <div class="code-block slightly-gray">
   <pre>
public class Flargle
{
    protected String m_sFoo ;
    protected String m_sBar ;

    public String getFoo()
    { return m_sFoo ; }

    public Flargle setFoo( String s )
    { m_sFoo = s ; return this ; }

    public String getBar()
    { return m_sBar ; }

    public Flargle setBar( String s )
    { m_sBar = s ; return this ; }

    public String toString()
    {
        return (new StringBuilder())
            .append( m_sFoo ).append( " " )
            .append( m_sBar ).append( "!" )
            .toString()
            ;
    }
}

public class FlargleBarg
{
    public void testFlargle()
    {
        Flargle flargle = (new Flargle()).setFoo( "Hello" ).setBar( "world" ) ;
        assertEquals( "Hello world!", flargle.toString() ) ;
    }
} 
   </pre>
  </div>
 </div>
 <h3>Copy and Paste Only Once</h3>
 <div class="body">
  <p>
   As a general rule, if it's worth copying and pasting once, then it's worth
   pasting into a <i>method</i> which can be reused. This increased modularity
   ensures that, if that bit of repetitive code ever has to be tested or 
   changed, then those tests and changes will be needed only once, and all 
   consumers of that code can be left alone as much as possible; that is, the
   singular change may be confined to a nicely-limited context.
  </p> <p>
   Besides, you never know when that new, factored-out method might become
   useful in some other way. Many of the features of this library were,
   themselves, bits of reusable code required across several of our own
   projects.
