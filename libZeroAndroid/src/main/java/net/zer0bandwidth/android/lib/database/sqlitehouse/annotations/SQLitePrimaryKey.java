/**
 * Designates a column as the primary key of its table.
 *
 * <p>Because SQLite prefers to have auto-incremented integer keys in all of its
 * tables, the definition of "primary key" here is a bit loose. Rather than
 * trying to declare this column as a primary key, {@code SQLiteHouse} will
 * actually create this table as merely {@code UNIQUE} but then <i>treat</i>
 * the column as a primary key for all operations that would want one, including
 * key-based searches, references across tables, etc. Meanwhile, it will
 * silently also manage a <code>_id</code> field as the <i>actual</i> primary
 * key that is reported to SQLite.</p>
 *
 * <p>See {@link net.zer0bandwidth.android.lib.database.sqlitehouse.SQLiteHouse}
 * for details of how this fits into the overall framework.</p>

 * @since zer0bandwidth-net/android 0.1.4 (#26)
